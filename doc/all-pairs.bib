    abstract = {{Given a large collection of sparse vector data in a high dimensional space, we investigate the problem of finding all pairs of vectors whose similarity score (as determined by a function such as cosine distance) is above a given threshold. We propose a simple algorithm based on novel indexing and optimization strategies that solves this problem without relying on approximation methods or extensive parameter tuning. We show the approach efficiently handles a variety of datasets across a wide setting of similarity thresholds, with large speedups over previous state-of-the-art approaches.}},

A method of “descriptive words” for definition of near-duplicates of documents is suggested. It is based on the choice of N words from the index to determine a “signature” of a document and can be applied to any search engine based on the inverted index. It is compared with the method based on “shingles”. At a practically equal accuracy of algorithms, this method is more efficient in the presence of inverted index.}, booktitle={Proc 11 th Int World Wide Web Conference WWW’2002}, author={Ilyinsky, S and Kuzmin, M and Melkov, A and Segalovich, I}, year={2002}}
